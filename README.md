# Cardano offchain metadata registry

A reference implementation of a Cardano [CIP-26](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master/CIP-0026) compliant offchain metadata registry.

## Introduction

This repository contains an implementaiton of a [CIP-26](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master/CIP-0026) compliant offchain metadata registry for Cardano. It exposes an extended API (see the OpenAPI v3 spec hosted by our staging deployments [here](https://api.metadata.staging.cf-deployments.org/apidocs)) with regards to the one specified in [CIP-26](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master/CIP-0026) to allow for more querying options and also write access to the registry to get rid of parts of the GitHub based process (but still stick to the known [GitHub repository](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cardano-token-registry) as a single source of truth for now).

Implementation of client tools for metadata creation can be found [here](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-metadata-app) and at [IOG's reference implementation repository](https://github.com/input-output-hk/offchain-metadata-tools).

## Getting started

### Prerequisites
In order to use the scripts that populate data from the registry Github repository into the database you need [Python v3](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

At the moment the application needs a PostgreSQL database as a storage layer. This will change in the future. However, you can use the [liquibase](https://www.liquibase.org/) database migration scripts provided in our [deployment repository](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-metadata-deployment/tree/main/database) to initialize this database.

If you are not familiar with PostgreSQL here are the few steps needed to spin up an instance using Docker and use some of our deployment scripts to populate the correct schema, create a user which can be used by the REST service.

**Step 1** Start a dockerized PostgeSQL instance listening on port 5432 for new connections and specify some access credentials for the database administrator:
```console
$ docker run -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=n0tr3allyS3cuR3 -e POSTGRES_USER=cardano_admin -d postgres
```

**Step 2** Rollout the database schema and create a user that will be facilitated by the REST API to access the database:
```console
# clone the deployment repository
$ git clone git@github.com:cardano-foundation/cf-metadata-deployment.git

# enter the database migration folder within the deployment repository
$ cd cf-metadata-deployment/database/postgres/scripts

# rollout the schema and create a user that can later be used by the REST API service
$ DBA_USER_SECRET=n0tr3allyS3cuR3 DBA_USER_NAME=cardano_admin METADATA_DB_NAME=cf_metadata SERVICE_USER_SECRET=again3asy2hack SERVICE_USER_NAME=cardano_service ./bootstrap_database.sh
$ DBA_USER_SECRET=n0tr3allyS3cuR3 DBA_USER_NAME=cardano_admin METADATA_DB_NAME=cf_metadata SERVICE_USER_SECRET=again3asy2hack SERVICE_USER_NAME=cardano_service ./migrate_database.sh
```

**Step 3** Populate data into the database based on the latest revision of the metadata registry:
```console
$ mkdir tmp
$ pushd tmp
$ git clone git@github.com:cardano-foundation/cardano-token-registry.git
$ pushd cardano-token-registry
$ git checkout master
$ git pull
$ export REGISTRY_CLONE_FOLDER="`pwd`/"
$ popd
$ popd
$ pushd cf-metadata-deployment/deployment/aws/images/gitsync-task
$ DBA_USER_SECRET=n0tr3allyS3cuR3 DBA_USER_NAME=cardano_admin METADATA_DB_NAME=cf_metadata SERVICE_USER_SECRET=again3asy2hack SERVICE_USER_NAME=cardano_service ./populate_data.sh
$ popd
$ rm -Rf tmp
```

## How to build?

Clone this repository
```console
$ git clone git@github.com:cardano-foundation/cf-metadata-server.git
```

`cd` into the directory where `git` did clone the sources into and build the application via Maven
```console
$ cd cf-metadata-server
$ mvn package
```

## How to run?

### Run the JAR directly
Run the application (assuming we are using the database setup in the section above):
```console
$ java -DdbUser="cardano_service" -DdbSecret="again3asy2hack" -jar api/target/api-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

Check if the application is running and connectivity to the database is given:
```console
$ curl http://localhost:8080/v2/health
```

### Run in a local Docker container
There exists a [shell script](./api/run_locally.sh) in this repository that can be used to spin up the application including a dockerized PostgreSQL instance, have the latest schema deployed, the latest data from the [registry GitHub](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cardano-token-registry) populated and the application initialized to run on port 8081 listening for http connections.
```console
$ ./run_local.sh -b
```

Check if the application is running and connectivity to the database is given:
```console
$ curl http://localhost:8081/v2/health
```

### Configuration
Following parameters can be used to configure the application:
| Parameter name | Description | Default |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| dbConnectionParamsProviderType | Specify whether database connection config shall be pulled from system properties or AWS SSM. Possible values are `ENVIRONMENT` and `AWS_SSM` | `ENVIRONMENT` |
| dbUser | user name used to access the database | `none` |
| dbSecret | password used to access the database | `none` |
| dbDriverName | the database driver to use | `org.postgresql.Driver` |
| dbUrl | connection string without user credentials | `jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/cf_metadata` |
| region | the AWS region the AWS SSM parameters are deployed to | `none` |
| rdsUsernameSsmParameterName | the name of the AWS SSM parameter holding the database user name | `none` |
| rdsPasswordSsmParameterName | the name of the AWS SSM parameter holding the database password | `none` |
| rdsUrlSsmParameterName | the name of the AWS SSM parameter holding the database connection string | `none` |
| rdsDriverClassNameSsmParameterName | the name of the AWS SSM parameter holding the database driver name | `none` |

## Features

Offchain metadata related:
- [x] Expose CIP-26 compliant REST API
- [x] Advanced querrying REST API

WIP:
- [ ] Expose write access functions via REST API for creating, modifying and deleting offchain metadata
- [ ] Expose verification API for offchain metadata based on extended CIP-26 trust concept

Later:
- [ ] Modular storage backend with support for different RDS backends (SQLite, MySQL), S3 based storage (MinIO, AWS), MongoDB
- [ ] JSON-LD support and schema.org registration
- [ ] Include onchain token metadata like proposed in a [CIP draft](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/137)
- [ ] Example deployments using Kubernetes and Docker Compose
- [ ] Decentralized offchain registry based on QUIC and Gossip
