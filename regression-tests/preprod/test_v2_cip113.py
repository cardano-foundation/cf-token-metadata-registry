V2 API: CIP-113 programmable tokens on preprod. See shared/cip113_suite.py.

Most of the tokens registered on preprod are tests without metadata; they have no companion and are served with a CIP-113
error that says so (ADR-020). A token with on-chain metadata is served with its validation errors (ADR-019); WITH_MANDATORY_ERRORS lists those whose metadata
misses something its CIP requires, with the reason, so they are hidden with validation=MANDATORY_ONLY.
